# Offset_Binary_Coding-OBC-
 Offset Binary Coding(OBC) is an another technique used to calculate the inner product of two vectors.The operations of OBC is same as Distributed Arithmetic(DA).But,the problem with DA is, as number of elements in fixed vector i.e fixed coefficients increases,LUT size becomes more which results more accessing time.
Offset Binary Coding is one of the technique to overcome this problem.In OBC,we reduce the LUT size to half which helps in reducing the accessing time.When compare to DA,OBC takes more area but speed is high.Due to the XOR gates used for the address generation,area becomes more in OBC.Based on the requirement,we choose DA and OBC techniques.
