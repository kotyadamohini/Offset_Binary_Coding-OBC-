# Offset_Binary_Coding-OBC-
 Offset Binary Coding(OBC) is an another technique used to calculate the inner product of two vectors.The operations of OBC is same as Distributed Arithmetic(DA).But,the problem with DA is, as number of elements in fixed vector i.e fixed coefficients increases,LUT size becomes more which results less accessing time.
